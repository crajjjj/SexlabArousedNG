<INSTRUCTIONS>
Follow these local rules when working in this repo:
- Prefer `rg` for search and `rg --files` for file listing.
- Avoid destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `rm`) unless explicitly asked.
- Do not revert unrelated changes in a dirty worktree.
- Prefer `apply_patch` for single-file edits.
- Keep edits ASCII unless the file already contains non-ASCII.
- Be concise in explanations; reference files with inline code paths.
- Keep UTF-16 LE BOM encoding for translation files
- Papyrus doesn't have break and continue commands
